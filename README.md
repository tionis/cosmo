# Cosmo
Cosmo is a simple git-based dotfile management tool, with some added features that I found useful.  
*Warning*: Cosmo is by far not ready to be used by anyone else most certainly not for production, many features are inconsistent or not implemented at all. Code quality will also need an overhaul for release.
